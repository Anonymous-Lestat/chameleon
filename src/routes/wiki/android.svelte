        Chameleon can be installed from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/chameleon-ext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMO</a>
        or the <a href="/chameleon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home page</a>, however, this version comes with a limitation: options that require the privacy permission can not be changed.
        This is caused by an issue with the privacy permission; it can not be requested by the user on Android devices. This conflicts with desktop users.
        As of v0.21.2, Chameleon now has a special build for Android users that restores this functionality.
